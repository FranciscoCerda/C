# PIA: Hangman Game 

## Description

For this project I make a code which let you play "Hangman" or "Ahorcado" in Spanish. 
The options to introduce the words are: a user type the word to guess; the program reads 
the words from the code and select one randomly. The player will try to guess these words. 
It is possible to change the words that are in the code for different ones, but for the moment those are the preset.

If you have played "Hangman", you will have noticed that if you commit mistakes when guessing letters, 
a little stick-man will be draw under a gallows. When starting the program, after you have chosen your game mode, 
the gallows will be draw with ASCII characters and the spaces in which the correct letters that we choose will be 
written will be placed below it. In case of choosing an incorrect letter, our little stick-man will be printed little by little, 
being hung on the gallows. There will be a maximum of 6 attempts (arms, legs, body and head).

## Self-evaluation
1: complexity 2 (not very complicated)

2: functionality 2 (has some errors with printing)

3: code 3 (is a bit long, could be shortened)

4: storage 2

5: documentation 3 (the video is very simple)
